## Hi, I'm Shangyi Zhu 👋

**AI Algorithm Engineer** based in Shanghai, focused on **LLM applications & Agent systems**.

7 years of engineering experience — 5 years building large-scale data infrastructure at NIO (autonomous driving data) and SAIC-GM (intelligent connected vehicles), and 2+ years transitioning into LLM application development. Currently building a multi-agent Q&A platform for the banking domain.

I work at the intersection of **data engineering and LLMs** — turning messy enterprise data into reliable AI products.

### 🔭 What I'm working on

- **Bank Intelligent Q&A Platform** — Multi-agent architecture with NL2SQL, RAG, and tool-calling routing. Built on LangGraph with BGE-M3 hybrid retrieval and Qwen-series models.
- **Medical RAG System** — Tri-modal hybrid retrieval (dense + sparse + ColBERT) over Milvus/HNSW, with LangGraph orchestration and RAGAS evaluation. ChatGLM3-6B fine-tuned with LoRA/QLoRA.
- **Exploring** — Multimodal agents, agent evaluation frameworks, and production deployment patterns (vLLM, quantization).
